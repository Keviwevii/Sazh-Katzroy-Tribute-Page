        <h1>Sazh Katzroy - Final Fantasy XIII</h1>
        <p>
          Sazh is a friendly, cheerful man who is never without his curious
          companions—a chocobo chick and a pair of pistols. He is quick to
          banter, but also keeps a mature perspective on matters. Uncontrollable
          events have set him on his current path, but another purpose compels
          him to walk it.

        Sazh Katzroy [sæz 'kæt͡s.ɹɔɪ] is a playable character in Final Fantasy
        XIII and in a downloadable episode of Final Fantasy XIII-2. He appears
        as a non-player character in Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII. He
        is a middle-aged man with an afro who works as an airship pilot. After
        his wife died three years before the events of Final Fantasy XIII, Sazh
        has been looking after their son, Dajh. Protecting his son is Sazh's
        main motivation. A pet chocobo lives in Sazh's afro, known simply as
        Chocobo Chick. In Final Fantasy XIII-2, Sazh, Dajh, and the Chocobo
        Chick are consumed by a paradox and Sazh ends up in Serendipity where he
        needs to gamble to reclaim his son. In Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy
        XIII, a grief-stricken Sazh has isolated himself in the Wildlands.
